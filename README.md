# Holden's Tab Limiter

This is a firefox extension that limits the maximum number of open tabs.

When the maximum number of tabs is reached, opening another tab will mark it as temporary.

The temporary tab will be moved to a tab group called Temporary.

There will never be more than one temporary tab.
