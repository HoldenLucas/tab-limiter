# Holden's Tab Limiter

This is a Firefox extension that limits the maximum number of open tabs.
When the tab limit is reached, opening another tab will put it in a tab group called the Temporary tab group (TTG).
The TTG will only contain at most one tab.
If there is already a tab in the TTG, opening another tab will close the existing temporary tab.
